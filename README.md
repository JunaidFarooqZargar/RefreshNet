**RefreshNet: Learning Multiscale Dynamics through Hierarchical Refreshing**

Welcome to the RefreshNet repository! This repository contains the datasets, codebase, and trained models used in our paper. We aim to promote reproducibility and provide resources for the scientific community to explore and build upon our work.

## Datasets
- **FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) System**: The datasets for FHN are available, along with the code to generate the full dataset.
- **Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) Dynamics**: The code to generate the KS datasets is uploaded.
- **Reaction-Diffusion (RD) Problem**: Due to the large size of the RD dataset, it is not currently hosted on GitHub. We are exploring alternative hosting options. Stay tuned for updates!

## Trained Models
You can find the trained models in the `Models` folder. These models are utilized in the hierarchical layers of RefreshNet.

## Training Code
The training code will be uploaded soon. We are currently finalizing the necessary details to ensure the codebase is comprehensive and well-documented.

## Note on Code and Dataset Release
While some datasets and the code to generate them are already available, there is a temporary delay in the public release of the entire codebase due to potential intellectual property rights and patent opportunities. We anticipate making the remaining codebase and datasets publicly available soon. Thank you for your understanding.
